I compiled a list of helpful tips and tricks to kick start your journey to hacking. This list is updated. The method works. Just do your own diligence and don't slack off, you'll get to where you want to go!



Hacking is for everyone. Fight the system!




~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1- Keylogger
Most sources define a keylogger as a software program designed to secretly
monitor and log all keystrokes. This definition is not altogether correct, since
a keylogger doesn’t have to be software – it can also be a device. Keylogging
devices are much rarer than keylogging software, but it is important to keep
their existence in mind when thinking about information security.
You can use keyloggers to hack any account fast and easy.
It will basically sends you every single keystroke the victim does.
So you can see the passwords and emails they type in browsers or even read their
written emails/ private messages.
There are also keylogger apps such as mSpy and iKeyMonitor which means it is
possible to create one on nearly every system possible.
Here are some keylogger tools:

A Keylogger for Andriod:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2- Bruteforcing:
A brute-force-attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords with the
hope of eventually guessing correctly.
The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until
the correct one is found.
Theoretically it is possible to hack every password on this earth possible since
you could even brute-force 2fa codes.
But now comes up the question- Why does noone use this method?
The answer is simple: Time and Physical limits.
No matter how good your PC are some passwords are just so extremely complex that
trying to get them by a brute-force attack would take billions of years to crack.
The brute-force method is only good when you know what the password MIGHT be so
here are some tools incase you know what to do.

Dirsearch:

Callow:
https://callow.vercel.app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3- Dictionary attack
In contrast with a brute-force attack, where all possibilities are searched
through exhaustively, a dictionary attack only tries possibilities which are most
likely to succeed,
typically derived from a wordlist or a dictionary. Generally, dictionary attacks
succeed because many people have a tendency to choose passwords which are short,
single words in a dictionary, or are simple variations that are easy to predict.
A lot of people use those combinations as their password:
Name + random number
Name + date of birth
Name + !§=)$ etc.
Family name + random number
Family name + date of birth
...
This is why collection information is important since you need to know how his
full name is and the names of his family members or friends.
Maybe the name of the dog or the name of an old friend could be the solution to
crack the password.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
4- Pwned and leaked Data
It is possible hack people with only an E-Mail through that
"Have i been pwned" allows you to search across multiple data breaches to see if
your email address, old password or phone number has been compromised.
You can put in the email of the victim or even an old password of them. It will
display if any of their date ever got leaked to the public due to hacked/
leaked databases and mass hacking attacks.
If you see the warning "Oh no - pwned!" You basically won because the website
will display you which kind of leak lead to the password of the victm
beeing publicly avaible. You can end up downloading the leaked database on
different public forums and then end up using it for yourself.
There is even one for internet bankings so try it out yourself.
533 million Facebook users' phone numbers and personal data have been leaked
online. Yaho had a big ass databreach in 2017 too.
You can download all of them on random forums and hope that your victims data are
one of them.
This is how it would look like if the E-Mail/ Password already got leaked.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5- Phishing
Phishing is a common scam that attempts to lure you into giving up your username,
password, or other sensitive information by using a replica of an original app/
login page/ Website.
This can be done to any device possible it is typcally spread by email.
The email may appear to come from ECSU or another company you do business with,
and it often asks you to click a link, open an attachment, or reply with your
account or personal information.
Social engineering isn't always simplest constrained to guessing passwords.
You can use the method to force your victim to a click on a phishing web page
which you have in particular created to gather passwords.
You have to persuade the person to log of their account through your web page via
social engineering.
You can to lure them on your web page with the promise of free money/ free leaks
or more shit like that.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
6- Password Reset
This method is pretty easy and must be combined with social engineering.
You need to have a physical access to the phone to simply request the victims
account and request the following app for a password reset.
If you do not have phsyiscal access to the victims device you can simply request
a new password with their account. The code will be sent to the person as an SMS.
It is possible to tell the person beforehand things like:
"My account needs a new number can i use yours?" or "I need to verify my account
but my number does not work can i use yours?"
This method is also used to steal someone else’s Instagram account permanently.
Another Method is to ask the person a lot of personal questions like whats your
mums name and dads name etc etc.
The kind of questions that you need to answer the security questions for.
Collect them all but let it seem like a normal conversation and thats how you do
it!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


7- Linked accounts
A majority of Instagram users have linked their Facebook accounts on them. If you
can hack someone’s Facebook account, you willl also get automatic access to
their Instagram account.
This kind of method works with a lot of other social media accounts too. Facebook
accounts are also linked to tons of games which means you will also get
access to their game accounts for example Dragon City.
Works with Facebook Mobile Games:
Daily Soduko
Master Archer
Draw Something
Words with Friends
8 Ball Pool
Super Dash
Mahjong Trails Blitz
Jewel Academy
Tomb Runner
Word Life
Dragon Land
World Chef
Dragon Land
Tasty Town
Dragon City
Monster Legends
(Finding those kind of Accounts IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND THEY ARE AND EXPENSIVE
AT THE SAME TIME
SO IT IS A PERFECT LOOT FOR SOMEONE WHO SELLS ACCOUNTS!!!!!!)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

8- Exploits and Vulnerabilities
An exploit is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands
that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in an application or a system to
cause unwanted effects.
The name comes from the English verb to exploit, meaning “to use something to
one’s own advantage”.
Basically, this means that the target of an attack suffers from a design flaw
that allows people to create the means to access it and use it in his interest.
Among the most well-known web-based security vulnerabilities are: SQL injection
attacks, cross-site scripting , cross-site request forgery and broken
authentication code or security misconfigurations. In general, exploits can be
clasified in two main categories: known and unknown (or zero-day
vulnerabilities).
The zero-day vulnerabilities are by far the most dangerous, as they happen when a
software contains a critical security vulnerability of which the programmer or
the owner of the software is unaware of.
So now that you know what an exploit its let me show you how to abuse them and
how to find them.
How to find exploits [ONLY FOR HIGHLY EXPERIENCED HACKERS]:
It’s not like every nth line of code has something exploitable. Software that
tries to do certain things, fails in certain ways, over and over and over again.
So mostly we look for the old problems, and port them over to their new hosts.
There are three main strategies for finding bugs.
Design review
Basically just look at what it’s trying to do, and figure out if it did it wrong.
Code review — look at how it’s built, either as source code or compiled binaries
(both help, both matter). And Fuzzing.
Fuzzing
Fuzzing is basically throwing noise at software, and seeing what happens. Bugs
might only show up one out of a million tests, but if you try things a hundred
million times, you’re going to get a hundred bugs.
Fuzzing gets smarter each passing year. What that means is that instead of
throwing random noise at code, we watch what happens as we talk to the software,
and learn from it. Bugs are not random, because software is not random. You have
to *reach* a bug, in order to find it.
Alternatively, if you’re twenty levels deep into a program and you find a
problem, who knows if that problem is even exploitable. Anywhere along those 19
layers above you might be something that stops you. Often it’s a hassle to figure
that out.
SAT and SMT solvers are technologies that automate figuring out if things are
exploitable after all. They’re quite effective. These solvers of course are used
in a variety of ways; they’re probably the most effective “machine learning” tech
in security right now.
Finding Access Vulnerabilities
What generally happens is that an advanced or elite hacker writes a scanning tool
that looks for well-known vulnerabilities, and the elite hacker makes it
available over the Internet. Less experienced hackers, commonly called "script
kiddies," then run the scanning tool 24 x 7, scanning large numbers of systems
and finding many systems that are vulnerable. They typically run the tool against
the name-spaces associated with companies they would like to get into.
The script kiddies use a list of vulnerable IP addresses to launch attacks, based
on the vulnerabilities advertised by a machine, to gain access to systems.
Depending on the vulnerability, an attacker may be able to create either a
privileged or non-privileged account. Regardless, the attacker uses this initial
entry (also referred to as a "toe-hold") in the system to gain additional
privileges and exploit the systems the penetrated system has trust relationships
with, shares information with, is on the same network with, and so on.

YOU DO NOT NEED TO FIND EXPLOITS TO USE THEM!
There are tons of exploits that are public and they are still not fixed because
people do not update their system and websites do not pay for any kind of
security most of the times. There are well known and legal databases that display
every kind of exploit that is public yet.
There are tons of different exploits from different Softwares and Hardwares.
Totally free to copy and abuuse.
So here is where you can find them.

9- Create fake apps:
If you can already create a fake Instagram login page in Method 3 above, then why
not create a fake Instagram app that looks exactly like the original and collect
users’ data from the app? It is easy to create an Instagram clone app if you have
the necessary skills or the patience and time to learn Android Application
development. Once you have built your app, the remaining job is to make sure your
victim downloads the fake app on their phone and uses it to log in to Instagram.
Make sure the app redirects the targeted person to the real Instagram login page
after you’ve collected their data in order to avoid raising any suspicion.
The basic concept in social engineering is to trick your victims to tell you
their username and password indirectly. Social engineering has been around for
years. It is an art of making people to actually give you specific information
that you are looking for rather than use brute force or spy apps to get the
information.
Most social engineering tricks are used to get the victim’s username and password
combination for a specific website. You can apply the same social engineering
skills to acquire the Instagram username and password from your targeted victim
and use the data to gain access into their Instagram account. Most social
engineering skills typically imitate a representative from the platform, in this
case Instagram, who contacts you about a breach in the company’s security which
has made it necessary for all users to change their passwords. They’ll even ask
you to provide a unique password for your account.
Most Instagram social engineering tactics work 50% of the time in the real world.
All it takes to succeed in social engineering is to have a good understanding of
your victim’s typical behavior and what kind of password they’d set for their
account. You’d be surprised by the number of people who use their names, their
pet’s name, or girlfriend’s phone number as their password. Most people are quite
predictable once you get to know them well.

HOW TO SPREAD YOUR MALWARE:
1) Youtube Tutorials
This is literally one of the easiest ways to do it.
First step:
You can either create a new YouTube account which will accuire tons of work and
advertising to get BARELY any views.
OR you can buy a YouTube channel with a high amount of followers instead.
Those are Websites on where you could buy YouTube Accounts:
https://accs-market.com/youtube
(Best one in my opinion (PAY WITH PAYPAL SO YOU CAN RQUEST FOR A REFUND IINCASE
YOU GET SCAMMED))
and
https://fameswap.com/browse-youtube-accounts-for-sale
(I HAD NO EXPERIENCE WITH THIS WEBSITE)
The titles on the videos you post should be looking like this:
CSGO HACK FREE NOW [WALLHACK, AIMBOT]
GTA V MOD MENU [UNDETECTED] 2.000.000 IN ONE SECOND!
DISCORD NITRO GENERATOR [100k CODES IN ONE SECOND]
DISCORD TOKEN GENERATOR ....
and so on
Second step:
Depending on how lazy you are you can either make your own tutorials or download
videos from other YouTubers and change the description
with your malware infected tool.
In the description of the video you need to provide a link to download the Mod/
Hack/Scriptin this case it's your own RAT/ Malware/ Miner or whatever you wanna
use.
Third step:
This one is not really necessary but you can try to advertise your videos to
other people on Discord or other platforms where you think people
might be intrested in your content. There are a lot of Discord servers where you
are able to post your YouTube video in without getting banned nor muted.
Do it frequently and build up your own viewerbase.
This is it. This is how easy it is.
2) Phishing Emails
You can use opensource scripts to spam phishing Emails to tons of other people.
This will increase your chance in someone falling for the malware you are sending
them.
Keep in mind:
People would rather open excel and word files than EXE files so you can also use
files like "YOUR DATA.xls"
People would trust an email with a credible message (No spelling mistakes,
professionality)
Try to pressure the victim to answer (This Link will only work for 24 hours...
etc)
Here are some Emails for you
3) Pastebin/ Hastebin method
Spread your malware download links on Hate-/Pastebin.
This will help you since a lot of people use those Websites to upload their
stuff. They ususally dork around on google to find new accounts or methods
and they will end up finding your Malware through your Keywords that you added to
your post uploaded text and link.
Use those those Websites to get good Keywords:
https://keywordtool.io/
https://ahrefs.com/de/keyword-generator
https://www.internet-marketing-inside.de...-Tool.html
4) Hacking Forums
Those are one of the best tactics because nearly everyone does it.
All of those people do not use their brain and if there is a malware that did not
get detected
by Virustotal EVERYONE would download it and the staff would also not notice it.
Threads are really easy to create and they have absolutely no limitations at all.
You can post whatever you want and as long as the malware isnt too obvious you
are able to spread it for a long long time.
And if you get banned? Create a new account thats all it takes.
5) E-whoring
This Method is not only a good way to make tons of money but also an awesome way
to get private information of people.
So you're first going to want to create a Snapchat/ Pintrest/ Instagram account
with a spam email.
Make sure to add tons of details to the profile to make it look more believable.
For example verify the E-Mail have some followers and posts etc.
Do not spam add or spam follow people because social media apps all restricted
spam-like behaviour.
So if you wanna be careful: take it slow.
The best platforms to like spread your snapchat name is basically Yubo, Hoop or
Omegle chat.
Use any E-Whoring leak you can find and send it to people after holding on a long
conversation with them.
From there you are free to do with the person whatever you want. Because if she
starts loving you you can send and tell them to do whatever you want.
You can even get them to send you money from there on and and even get them to
spread your malware to more people.
6) Automated Methods
You can either leave an accuont e whoring for you through using multiple chat
bots or automated spam scripts that spam the download link to other people.
Those are the typical spam messages or groupchats you get on Instagram. You would
ignore it but trust me tons of other people do click on the links
without even hesitating.
Another method would be to basically inject the malware into a game or a well
known app and let your close friend circle use it and get them to somehow spread
it all around their
own friend-group too. You can use it for your own class you are in or a
university.
A game app is hard to analyze and noone has the skill required to do it so you
can abuse the lack of knowledge in here for you own advantage.
Get Discord Mass DM Scripts and advertise that malware with stolen or bought
tokens.
Tokens are extremly cheap and you can buy 1k for barely 4 Euro. You can even buy
token generators for like 60 Euro and they will work forever.
